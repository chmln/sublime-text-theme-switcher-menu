## Preamble
Sublime Text has many themes available for download from Package Control and many of them are very cool looking. But, there is a slight problem with the entire theme system on activating themes.

For example, let's say I am browsing for Themes on Package Control.

I searched for Themes and I found the "Flatland" theme. I installed it directly from Sublime Text and then I want to try the theme out.

Now the only way to do so, is to open my Preferences file, and modify it to activate Flatland.

So, in my preferences, I modified the `theme` key to become `Flatland.sublime-theme`. But the Theme did not activate.

Wait, why? Because the theme file is named `Flatland Dark.sublime-theme`. So to activate the Theme, I have to go to the Flatland GitHub page and then search for Instructions.

So, just to activate a Theme, I have to do a lot of work.

That's where Theme Switcher jumps in. Theme Switcher automatically adds your Themes to the Menu from which you can easily Activate your Themes. Theme Switcher also displays multiple variants of Themes so that you can use them all at ease. For example, all variants of the "Afterglow" Theme can be accessed and activated from the GUI itself.

For ease of use, all themes and their variants are sorted alphabetically.

## Install
Install the `Themes Menu Switcher` from [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/)

## Use
Themes can be activated from `Preferences -> Theme` menu
