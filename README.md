## Preamble

Sublime Text has many themes available for download from Package Control and
many of them are very cool looking. But, there is a slight problem with the
entire theme system on activating themes.

For example, let's say I am browsing for Themes on Package Control.

I searched for Themes and I found the "Flatland" theme. I installed it
directly from Sublime Text and then I want to try the theme out.

Now the only way to do so, is to open my Preferences file, and modify it to
activate Flatland.

So, in my preferences, I modified the `theme` key to become
`Flatland.sublime-theme`. But the Theme did not activate.

Wait, why? Because the theme file is named `Flatland Dark.sublime-theme`.
So to activate the Theme, I have to go to the Flatland GitHub page and then
search for Instructions.

So, just to activate a Theme, I have to do a lot of work.

That's where Theme Switcher jumps in. Theme Switcher automatically adds your
Themes to the Menu from which you can easily Activate your Themes. Theme
Switcher also displays multiple variants of Themes so that you can use them
all at ease. For example, all variants of the "Afterglow" Theme can be
accessed and activated from the GUI itself.

For ease of use, all themes and their variants are sorted alphabetically.

## Install

Install the `Themes Menu Switcher` from
[Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/)

## Use

Themes can be activated from `Preferences -> Theme` menu.

You can also open the command pallet with <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd> and type:
- `Select Theme`
- `Select Color Scheme`

## Settings

Some plugins dynamically create themes or color schemes which are not meant to
be selected by a user. To hide those you can create a settings file
`Theme-Switcher.sublime-settings` and add the pathes to `"colors_exclude"` or
`"themes_exclude"` filter lists.

```js
{
	"colors_exclude":
	[
		"Packages/User/SublimeLinter",
		"Packages/User/Sublimerge"
	],
	"themes_exclude":
	[
		"Packages/zz File Icons/"
	]
}
```
